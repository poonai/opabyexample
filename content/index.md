# OPA By Example

Rego (pronounced "ray-go") is a high-level declarative query language, inspired by Datalog. It is used by OPA (Open Policy Agent) to define policies that are easy to read, write and understand, which means that you can state what your queries should return instead of describing how to do it. 

In other words, Rego is the policy language for defining rules that are evaluated by the OPA engine. OPA is written in Go (checkout gobyexample as well.)

Rego by Example is a hands-on introduction to Rego language using simple and concise code snippets on various language constructs. 
If you’re new here, Welcome mate!, we got you covered here, start with “Hello World”, or, browse the complete list below.

You can test and run your rego programs on  [Rego Playground](http://www.sdhs.com) Check out the official documentation to know more about rego and Open Policy Agent.
