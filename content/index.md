# OPA By Example

**Rego** (pronounced "ray-go") is a high-level declarative query language, inspired by Datalog. It is used by OPA (Open Policy Agent) to define policies that are easy to read, write and understand, which means that you can state what your queries should return instead of describing how to do it. 


In other words, Rego is the policy language for defining rules that are evaluated by the OPA engine. 

OPA is written in Go. Checkout [gobyexample](https://gobyexample.com) as well.

Rego by Example is a hands-on introduction to Rego language using simple and concise code snippets on various language constructs.
